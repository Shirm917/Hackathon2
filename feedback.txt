Hi Shir,

I absolutely love your Productivity app!
It looks simple, but once you go inside it's evident that you've incorporated complex structures, and you nailed it!

Your filing system is well organized, your server.js file is clean and to the point.

I liked the use of the bootstrap library

I appreciate the comments on every step of the way.

I love how you have minimum use of css and not many components (as a true backend developer) because bootstrap does the job for you! 
BUT we are full stack developers, so show me your use of components and css skills next time.

Overall, in such small period of time you've managed to create trello and I absolutely love it.

Very good job!
